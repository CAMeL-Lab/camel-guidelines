# CATiB Guidelines
The Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) formalism is a syntactic 
dependency representation used for the Arabic language.  
CATiB contrasts with previous approaches to Arabic treebanking
in its emphasis on speed with some constraints on linguistic richness. 
Two basic ideas inspire the CATiB approach: minimizing 
annotation of redundant information and
using representations and terminology inspired by traditional Arabic syntax.
